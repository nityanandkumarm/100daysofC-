Problem Statement: To find the quality rating of wine using deep learning.
Problem Description: Wine quality prediction is a complex task because of the long procedures involved and nature of the job itself. Wine takes a lot of time to produce and the wine tasting for quality rating is not a very easy job to determine the quality of wine.

Problem with existing approaches: Current approaches used try to leverage the different component in the wine like acidity, basicity and other contents to reach the result which does not provide good results due to following reasons:
  1) Wine taste is the result of mixture of different components and their diffusion in mouth at different times.
  2) It's inaccurate to do calculations based on chemicals present because it may be that their diffusion creates or alters their quantity during consumption giving different results then calculated by algorithms.

Solution: I tried to use a random forest algorithm to create different decision trees and create those hypothetical diffusions and try to reach a more accurate result.
